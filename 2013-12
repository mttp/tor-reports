December 2013
----------------------

I transferred 25 FAQ entries from the wiki FAQ page to the website,
making progress on #2133 and fixing #8665.

I contributed to the new wiki FAQ page for Tor Browser 3 at
https://trac.torproject.org/projects/tor/wiki/doc/TorBrowserBundle3FAQ.

I made weekly contributions to Tor Weekly News.

I helped test the Vidalia standalone bundles.

I talked with an organization that's willing to help us distribute training
materials for the Buoyant Otter project once we're ready.

I resolved 177 tickets on the help desk.
