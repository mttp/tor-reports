Things Matt Pagan did in January 2014
=====================================

Attended Buouyant Otter and Boisterous Otter meetings on IRC. 

Resolved 368 tickets on the help desk. 

Created 5 new English language articles for use on the help desk. 

Transferred the Tor Brower 3.5 FAQ entries from the wiki to the
website. 

Added 14 new FAQ entries to the website (besides the 8 mentioned above),
resolving tickets #10048, #10524 and #10628. 

Made other minor website improvements, for example a fix for ticket
#10768. 

Contributed to the first, second and third issues of the 
2014 Tor Weekly News. 

Synthesized my thus-far investigation of Mumble into a pull request
and call for help on tor-dev[0].
