In June I resolved 246 tickets on the help desk. Special thanks to
hellais for assistance with an Italian language help request.

I contributed to the first edition of the Tor Weekly News.

I hosted a cryptoparty in my living room, where we talked about Tor,
Tails and GPG.

I sent a petition to gutenberg.org asking them to stop blocking Tor. I
sent this petition as a Tor user and NOT as an official representative
of the Tor Project.
