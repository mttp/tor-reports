Here's what Matt P. did in December 2014
----------------------------------------

I did some Tor advocacy at the Chaos Communications Congress in Hamburg.

I contributed to the 74th, 75th, and 76th issues of Tor Weekly News.

I updated all gitweb links on the website to use cgit format(#14005).

I made two contributions to check that have now been pulled in:
https://github.com/arlolra/check/pull/26
https://github.com/arlolra/check/pull/25

I resolved 82 help desk tickets, concerning these topics:
[05] - [WARN] Proxy Client: unable to connect to XXX.XXX.XX.XX:31493 ("TTL
       expired") OR ("server rejected connection")
