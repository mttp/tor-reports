What Matt did August 2014
=========================

* I built Tor Expert Bundles for tor 0.2.5.6. Afterwards, I learned
  that the bundles need to be built deterministically to be released,
  so I did not try to get the bundles I made hosted on the website.

* I wrote a patch for #8376 ("Tor expert bundle requires "Run as
  Administrator" to install on Win 7 (and Win 8?)")

* I wrote a patch for Tor in #12830 ("Links in Tor's README are
  outdated").

* I contributed to the 57th, 59th, and 60th editions of Tor Weekly News.

* I reported on Help Desk issues during each weekly Tor Browser meetings.

* I agreed to start responding to requests for Tor weather T shirts.

* Below, I've categorized every single one of the 220 help desk tickets
  I resolved in August.
