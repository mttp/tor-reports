Here's what I did for Tor in April 2014:

* Resolved 326 help desk tickets.
* Modified the FAQ to more clearly discourage VPN use (#11398).
* Removed a broken link from the FAQ (#11572).
* Updated the SSL fingerprints listed on the FAQ (#11441).
* Updated the project page with the latest version of the Torbirdy logo
(#11546).
* Removed references to obfs2 from the obfsproxy bridge deployment
instructions (#11160).
* Contributed to the 40th, 41st, 42nd, and 43rd issues of Tor Weekly News.
* Created a first draft of the Tor Browser User Manual, which will
eventually be shipped with Tor Browser (#11669). I've submitted new
strings for the manual for review (#11652).
* Created 5 new articles for use on the Tor help desk:
  "Get your own bridges."
  "Set Country"
  "Link to warning page"
  "Just connect"
  "Can't set HTTP or SOCKS proxy."
