Matt P. in November 2014
------------------------

In November, I resolved 150 questions at the help desk.

I also spent some time reorienting after taking the month of
October off.

I spent some time talking with others about what would be
required for the Tor Project to support a Tor on iOS solution.

I contributed to the 70th, 71st, and 73rd issues of Tor Weekly News.

Here are the tickets I resolved this month, sorted by frequency.
