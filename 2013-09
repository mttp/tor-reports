I did the following in September:


I resolved 138 support tickets. 

I attended 2 Sponsor F meetings in #tor-dev. 

I submitted 2 small patches for https-everywhere[0]. 

I found myself in Washington, D.C. talking to people from several
different activist communities about Tor, Tails, GPG, Orbot, and other
privacy-enhancing technologies. From this experience I gained new
perspective on some of the ways activists in the United States think
about their online privacy, and what threats they face.

I went to PhreakNic[1]. I informally addressed some common
misconceptions people had about Tor and answered some questions about
recent Tor-related news. 

I wrote summaries of common help desk questions for Tor Weekly News
issues #10, #11, #12, #13 and #14. 

I read some QT documentation and other resources in order to
investigate a DNS leak in Mumble[2].

I began working with Sherief on a Firefox extension to do file
verification[3].
